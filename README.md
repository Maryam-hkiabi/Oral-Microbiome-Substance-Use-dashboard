# Oral Microbiome Substance Use Dashboard

This project focuses on understanding the oral microbiome in individuals who use substances such as tobacco, cannabis, or other drugs. The goal is to identify microbial species that are consistently found in higher or lower abundance in these populations, and to provide tools for analyzing and visualizing this data. It consists of two main components:

The **R Package â€“ OralMicrobiomeSubstanceUse**:
This package provides tools to analyze oral microbiome data, clean and process sequence data, run BLAST comparisons, and generate taxonomic visualizations. It allows researchers to compare microbial profiles between substance users and non-users, and among different types of substances, using either their own data or publicly available datasets.

The **Interactive Dashboard (this repository)**:
This front-end web dashboard presents a collection of reviewed studies that include associated sequence data related to the oral microbiome in substance users. Users can filter articles based on the microbial species studied, substance type, and microbial abundance patterns (e.g., higher/lower abundance). The dashboard also includes visualizations and a **direct link to the R Shiny app version** for dynamic exploration.

Together, the R package and dashboard provide a powerful toolkit for researchers, clinicians, and students working in microbiome science, public health, and bioinformatics. This integrated resource makes it easier to explore trends in microbial changes associated with substance use and promotes accessible, reproducible research.
